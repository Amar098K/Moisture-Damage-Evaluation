# Moisture Damage Evaluation in Asphalt Mixtures using Image Analysis

## Introduction

This repository contains an algorithm developed in Python for evaluating moisture damage in asphalt mixtures using image analysis techniques. The algorithm takes images of asphalt samples before and after exposure to moisture and calculates a moisture damage index, providing a quantitative assessment of the extent of damage.

## Features

- Image preprocessing to enhance the asphalt sample and moisture damage features.
- Segmentation of the asphalt and moisture-damaged areas using computer vision techniques.
- Calculation of a moisture damage index based on the pixel intensity differences between the two regions.
- Visualization of the moisture damage index and segmented regions on the original images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
